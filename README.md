# Thesis Project: Dutch Sign-Language-Recognition

This project is a part of my BA thesis at the University of Utrecht

These jupyter notebooks were used to find the results of this thesis. The results can be replicated by running the notebooks in order: Data Preprocessing -> Mediapipe -> Classifier_V1
