# Thesis Project: Dutch Sign-Language-Recognition

This project is a part of my BSC thesis at the University of Utrecht. Thesis document above.

These jupyter notebooks were used to acchieve the results of this thesis. The results can be replicated by running the notebooks in order specified in the thesis document with data from the CorpusNGT.



The best model weights for each model can be found in Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17QljpE5lziAYxUoSwVvYQq8EW7otYqLs?usp=sharing

Link to the preprocessed CorpusNGT data can be found in separate Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WrILLeU11cqIfu7Vs067Lc6J52P0_IAj?usp=sharing

The original CorpusNGT excel files are also provided for easy downloading, in case you might want to change the pre-processing or run it again yourself with the Data_Preprocesing.ipynb file. The test/train/val split is also provided in the CorpusNGT folder for the 10, 20, and 50 class conditions. The zip file contains the ISLR data where each folder is one gloss, and each occurrence contains 8 frames as well as the mediapipe and videomae feature files.
